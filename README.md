## Hi! This is my repository containing sample code of SOLID Principles!

They were created based on this [SOLID Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/solid-design/) at Udemy.
At first it had been written in Java, but I've changed it to Python.

### Basically the principles are:

__S__&nbsp; -> Single Responsability\
__O__&nbsp; -> Open/Close\
__L__&nbsp; -> Liskov's Substitution\
__I__&nbsp;&nbsp; -> Interface Segregation\
__D__&nbsp; -> Dependency Inversion

I've attached my notes from this course and they can be found in [here](/notes/SOLID%20Principles%20Notes.pdf).
