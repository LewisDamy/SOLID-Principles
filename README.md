## Hi! This is my repository containing sample code of SOLID Principles!

They were created based on this [SOLID Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/solid-design/) at Udemy.
At first it had been written in Java, but I've changed it to Python.

### Basically the principles are:

S -> Single Responsability\
O -> Open/Close
L -> Liskov's Substitution\
I  -> Interface Segregation\
D -> Dependency Inversion

I've attached my notes from this course and they can be found in [here](/notes/SOLID%20Principles%20Notes.pdf).
